	What the website can offer?</h1>


<p><p style="color:white;">
The website can offer how to avoid being scam by using fake news and how you can identify the fake news when reading one. It is very important to know
the fake news because it can make people believe the lies and not the truth.
It can also offer videos about fake news and a simple quiz about fake news to remind the client how to identify
the fake news.

	Introducing fake news</h1>

<p><p style="color:white;">

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, 
but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, 
or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.</p>

	Awareness of spreading false information</h1>
<p><p style="color:white;">It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. 
Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
